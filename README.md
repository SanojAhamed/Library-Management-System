# Library-Management-System
Library Management System is a Java-based software application

A library management system is a Software Application designed to manage all aspects of library operations, including cataloging, circulation and etc. In this project, Library Management System designed using NetBeans IDE based on Object Oriented Programming.We develop our application to a Public Library. So, we did not have various user roles, everyone who check-in and checkout are library member. And also, we decided to connect two databases which are user database and book database.Each page connected with a homepage.The library management system software helps in reducing operational costs. Managing a library manually is labor intensive and an immense amount of paperwork is involved. An automated system reduces the need for manpower and stationery. This leads to lower operational costs.The system saves time for both the user and the librarian.With just a click the user can search for the books available in the library.The 
automated system saves a considerable amount of time as opposed to the manual system.Our team want to make public library is a smart place as well as another library.
